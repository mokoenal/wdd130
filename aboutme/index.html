    <h2>Lindie</h2>
  <p>Hi Everyone! My name is Lindiwe, my friends call me Lindie, I am from South Africa. I am studying a degree in Applied Technology.
    I would love to learn more about coding. I am married with 3 kids, my eternal companion and I have been married for 15 years. 
    I love the outdoors, watching movies and listening to good music. I currently work for a bank full time, I enrolled in this degree to advance my career.
    I am so grateful to be a member of the church and for the opportunity that I have been given to further my studies.</p>
