      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I will like to create a website for small businesses and help them grow. The purpose of the website is to show future employers that I can help them attract new clients and retain the ones that they have. This will help them to increase their income, as it will lead to having more clients. The website will include the services that I offer, some information about me, my skills and how to contact me.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I will be working with small business owners who will like to create websites to help expand their businesses and be well known. These are owners that are ready to be known on a larger scale, the website will open more doors for them, as a lot of people love the digital world. Our colors will be bold, colorful and inviting. I will include pictures/images of the work that I have done, in order for them to have an idea of the work that I do.</p>  <!-- change this -->

<b>Testimonial</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
"My Business was struggling since 2020, covid costs me, I thought about closing it. I was on the internet when I came across a link to Small Business Services Websites, I clinked and it led me to their website. I booked an appointment, they helped me to plan and create my website. We created the website and within a couple of weeks, we received bookings and appointments. I could not believe it, as I was not an internet person. My Business survived because of building and creating my website. SBSW saved not only my Business, but my life and my business is still growing, as more people are attracted to the website daily".
